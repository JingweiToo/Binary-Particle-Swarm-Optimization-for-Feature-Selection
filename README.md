# Binary-Particle-Swarm-Optimization-for-Feature-Selection
I provide a simple binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) for feature selection tasks, which can select the potential features to improve the classification accuracy. 

The "Main" script demos an example on how to use BPSO with classification error rate (computed by KNN) as the fitness function for feature selection problem using benchmark data-set.
